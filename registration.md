<hr>

Registration for the 2020 Invitational will open in **late August 2020.**

In the meantime, if you're interested in attending,
<strong><a href="https://forms.gle/uUAmnpBDxtRqe7wNA">please fill out our interest form</a></strong>
so we can keep you up to date with the latest!

## Process

We will post a form asking for
- Primary contact (coach name and email)
- School name and state
- Number of teams to register

Shortly after you complete the registration form, we will send you a confirmation email.
A registration payment <!--of $100 per team--> is due within two weeks after you receive
the confirmation email.

<!--
## Registration Rules
- All teams are limited to 15 competing members as per Pennsylvania State rules.
- Due to limited availability of resources, we will only be able to accept the first 25 teams to fill out the form. Other teams will be placed on a waitlist.
- Each school may bring at most two teams.
- All teams must be registered with their corresponding state's Science Olympiad organization.
