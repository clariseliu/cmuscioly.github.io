Registration will open on **Friday, October 1st, 2021 at 4pm ET**

<a href="https://forms.gle/fzWHeDaDm9rqDRW4A"> Registration Form</a>

* Registration will be first-come, first-served.
* Our capacity is **25 teams**, with up to 3 teams per school. This is smaller than in the past 
due to COVID space restrictions.
* Any teams registering after the first 25 teams will be placed on a waitlist.
* Registration fees will be $100 per TEAM (not school). 
* In order to allow more teams to be able to participate, we will be releasing a financial need

As always, please feel free to reach out with questions or concerns at
<a href="mailto:cmuscioly@gmail.com">cmuscioly@gmail.com</a>.
