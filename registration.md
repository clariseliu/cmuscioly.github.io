# Registration
<hr>

**UPDATE:** Registration will open on **Saturday, September 22nd** around noon.

## Process

We will post a form asking for
- Primary contact (coach name and email)
- School name and state
- Number of teams to register

Shortly after you complete the registration form, we will send you a confirmation email.
A registration payment of $100 per team is due within two weeks after you receive
the confirmation email.

## Registration Rules
- All teams are limited to 15 competing members as per Pennsylvania State rules.
- Due to limited availability of resources, we will only be able to accept the first 25 teams to fill out the form. Other teams will be placed on a waitlist.
- Each school may bring at most two teams.
