# Registration
<hr>

_Our 2021 tournament is coming!_  Read about the format of our 2021
invitational on our [tournament](/tournament/) page.

We are using the <strong><a href="https://scilympiad.com/pa-cmuso"
target="_blank">Scilympiad platform</a></strong> for team registration.
Please also make sure you are signed up for the mailing list below.

As of October 11, 2020, registration is officially **closed**, as we have
already met and far exceeded our initial team cap of 25 teams.  Unfortunately,
we were unable to complete registration for every team that logged into
Scilympiad, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the registration
process.

We are extremely grateful for the immense interest in our tournament from teams
across the country. If you were not able to register this year, we sincerely
appreciate your interest and hope to be able to host you in future years.

As always, please feel free to reach out with questions or conerns at
<a href="mailto:cmuscioly@gmail.com">cmuscioly@gmail.com</a>.
