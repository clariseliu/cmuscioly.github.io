# Registration
<hr>

_Our 2022 tournament is coming!_  Read about the details of our 2022
invitational on our [tournament](/tournament/) page.

Registration is now open! We still have open slots so please register using the form below. 

<a href="https://forms.gle/fzWHeDaDm9rqDRW4A"> Registration Form</a>

You can check your registration status <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aklP6_qMQsP9n1TwHgM7cCAnjCaTvSyLst17ul4FS6w/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

* Registration will be first-come, first-served.
* Our capacity is **25 teams**, with up to 3 teams per school. This is smaller than in the past 
due to COVID space restrictions.
* Any teams registering after the first 25 teams will be placed on a waitlist.
* Registration fees will be $100 per TEAM (not school). 
* In order to allow more teams to be able to participate, we will be releasing a financial need
based scholarship form soon to waive the registation fees for schools who qualify.
* We know that there is a lot of uncertainty with COVID, and that January is far away. So, we 
will be allowing to teams to register and withdraw until December 1st, 2021. If 
your team no longer feels comfortable with attending an in person invitational, 
then please email us at <a href="mailto:cmuscioly@gmail.com">cmuscioly@gmail.com</a> to update your registration status. 
Registration fees will be refunded in the case of withdrawal.
* If we feel an in-person tournament is no longer feasible, then we will switch to 
a virtual tournament on Scilympiad, and registration fees will also be lowered 
accordingly. Teams will also be given the option to withdraw if we decide to 
switch to virtual and they no longer want to participate.  

As always, please feel free to reach out with questions or concerns at
<a href="mailto:cmuscioly@gmail.com">cmuscioly@gmail.com</a>.
