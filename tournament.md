# 2021 Tournament
<hr>

Welcome to the 2020-2021 Science Olympiad season! The upcoming season will be
unique in many ways, but we're pleased to announce that we'll still be bringing
the CMU Science Olympiad experience to you in a safe and secure manner.

The 2021 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational is tentatively scheduled
for **Saturday, January 9th, 2021**. Events will only take place on Saturday.
However, due to the high level of interest, the tournament results will not be
available until a few days later.

We will be releasing more updates as we continue to plan; please sign up for
our mailing list to stay up to date.

## Mini SO

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are planning to hold a **Mini SO tournament**
this year, which we plan to conduct synchronously. In short:

1. The tournament will be run entirely remotely.
2. Team members and coaches are **not** required to meet physically.
3. As a result, we will not be able to run all events.

As the semester progresses and we start designing the events, expect much more
precise information regarding the tournament format. This is our first time
hosting a tournament in this format, and we're figuring things out as we go.

For more information on the "Mini SO" format, please check out the
<a href="https://www.soinc.org/play/tournaments" target="_blank">National Science Olympiad website</a>.

## Schedule of Events

Our event list has been finalized. In following with the PA Board's decisions,
we have made the following changes:

1. We will **not run** the Digital Structures event.
2. We will be using the CAD software **Tinkercad** for **Write It CAD It** (NOT
   SkyCiv).

Thus, our Mini SO tournament will run 19 events total, as follows, with Write
It CAD It being a **trial event**. Our Scilympiad page has been updated to
reflect these changes.

<blockquote class="ml-4">
<p>
  Anatomy, Astronomy, Chem, Circuit Lab, Codebusters, Designer Genes,
  Detector Building, Disease Detectives, Dynamic Planet, Experimental Design,
  Forensics Lab, Fossils, Geologic Mapping, Machines, Ornithology, Protein
  Modeling, Sounds of Music, Water Quality, Write It CAD It
</p>
</blockquote>

Wherever it makes a difference, we will be following the **Regionals rules**
for all events.
