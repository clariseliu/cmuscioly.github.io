# Tournament Information
<hr>

Carnegie Mellon University will be hosting its first Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament on **Saturday, January 12th, 2019** on its campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

We will be running all 23 Division C national events, including PA trial events. All exams are written at a regionals level and proofread by former Science Olympians who have competed at all levels of competition. We will be asking coaches to help run events.

Each school will be assigned to its own homeroom for the day. The tournament will run all day and end with an awards ceremony recognizing top teams and individuals.

As a mecca of STEM innovation, CMU is the perfect location to host a Science Olympiad tournament.
We’re excited to share the Carnegie Mellon experience with you!
