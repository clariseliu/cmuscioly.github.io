# 2022 Tournament
<hr>

<div class="row">

<div class="col">

<p>
The 2022 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational will take place on
<strong>Saturday, January 15th, 2022</strong>.
</p>

<p>
We are tentively planning for an in-person invitational, but plans may be
subject to change based on COVID case rates closer to the date. 
</p>

<br>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>
Registration is now open! Please see the <a href="/registration">registration</a> page for more details. Due to capacity 
restrictions on campus, we will only be allowing 25 teams to register with
a 3 team cap per school. Registration fees will be $100 per TEAM (not school). 
</p>

<p> 
We know that there is a lot of uncertainty with COVID, and that January is far away. So, we 
will be allowing to teams to register and withdraw until December 1st, 2021. If 
your team no longer feels comfortable with attending an in person invitational, 
then please email us at <a href="mailto:cmuscioly@gmail.com">cmuscioly@gmail.com</a> to update your registration status. 
Registration fees will be refunded in the case of withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
If we feel an in-person tournament is no longer feasible, then we will switch to 
a virtual tournament on Scilympiad, and registration fees will also be lowered 
accordingly. Teams will also be given the option to withdraw if we decide to 
switch to virtual and they no longer want to participate.  
</p>

<p>
In order to allow more teams to be able to participate, we will be releasing a financial need
based scholarship form soon to waive the registation fees for schools who qualify.
The scholarship form is available <a href="https://forms.gle/7ZnYcxLkTaHXogz28">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>COVID Protocols</h2>
<p>
We will be following all of CMU's COVID mitigation protocols. As of now, CMU has a mandatory
mask mandate on campus, which will also be enforced at the invitiational. Additionally we will be following the
restricted room capacity requirements in order reduce crowded gatherings. All students, coaches, and chaperones are also required by current CMU policy to either by vaccinated or have a negative COVID test that was from 72 hours prior to arriving on campus. These regulations are subject to change and can be found on the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/faqs/visitors.html">CMU COVID policy website</a> as well.
</p>

<h2>Schedule of Events</h2>

<p>
We will be running all 23 events from the official Division C Science Olympiad event. 
Currently we have no plan for trial events, but this may be subject to change. 
Where it makes difference, we will be following <strong> Regionals rules </strong> for all events.
</p>
<p>
A preliminary version of the schedule can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bV0PSX7svyK5UF2TvsRwgtxY0HMLlVw5np0gDxfFBO4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Event times may be subject to change. Event locations will be posted soon.
