<hr>
_Last updated: Friday, January 10, 2020_

We hosted our second invitational tournament on
**Saturday, January 11th, 2020**, on Carnegie Mellon's Pittsburgh campus.

## Results

See the [**final tournament results**](assets/results_2020.pdf).

The tournament's over! This year, for our second tournament, we were able
to host 25 teams &mdash; more than twice as many as the year before!
Thank you to all the teams who competed, to all the coaches for helping us
proctor events, and to all the volunteers who helped make this tournament
a reality. We hope you enjoyed attending our tournament as much as we
enjoyed hosting it, and we'll see you again next year!

## Tests and answer keys

For now, we will only send electronic copies of the tests and answer keys
to the teams who attended our tournament. We will release them publicly 
in May or June 2020, after the national tournament is over.

## Schedule of events

We plan to run all 23 of the official 2019 Division C events.
We will not be running any trial events.
Wherever it makes a difference, we will be following **regional rules**.
