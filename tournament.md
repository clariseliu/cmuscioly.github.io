# 2021 Tournament
<hr>
The 2021 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational is tentatively scheduled for
January 9th, 2021. However, given the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic, we
are currently unsure if we will be able to run the tournament safely. We are monitoring
the situation closely, and will announce our decisions regarding the tournament closer
to our usual registration period (September/October). If you would like to be notified
of updates to the status of the tournament by email, please fill out [our interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3ayXBegqOfQ6dHO395-I3V3TKnYjcd53JGWLj0T1MkCHuCA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
