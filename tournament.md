# 2022 Tournament
<hr>

<div class="row">

<div class="col">

<p>
The 2022 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational will take place on
<strong>Saturday, January 15th, 2022</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to offer a hybrid format for the upcoming tournament. Teams will now compete in a 100% remote satellite format. 
</p>
<p>
All exam events will be conducted via Scilympiad. We will send out the Scilympiad info once teams register via the Google form below. 
</p>
<p>
For lab events, they will no longer contain a lab portion and will be exam only. Events such as Write It Do It and Experimental Design will provide a list of common everyday items to coaches to have ready before the tournament. We are trusting that coaches will not provide this list to students beforehand to maintain integrity. 
</p>
<p>
For build events, we will be doing a satellite version. Builds will be done via live Zoom meeting. Teams will go one at a time and demosrate their build testing on the meeting. Any exam events with a build portion like It's About Time will have a scheduled exam portion and self-scheduled live Zoom build portion. 
</p>
<p>
Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns!
</p>

<h2>Schedule of Events</h2>

<p>
We will be running all 23 events from the official Division C Science Olympiad event. 
Currently we have no plan for trial events, but this may be subject to change. 
Where it makes difference, we will be following <strong> Regionals rules </strong> for all events.
All events will be run in a satellite format. 
</p>
<p>
A preliminary version of the schedule can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bV0PSX7svyK5UF2TvsRwgtxY0HMLlVw5np0gDxfFBO4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Event times may be subject to change. Event locations (for in-person teams) will be posted soon.
