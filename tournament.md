# Tournament Information
<hr>
Carnegie Mellon University will be hosting its first Science Olympiad Division C Invitational Tournament on **Saturday, January 12th, 2019** on its campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
As a Mecca of STEM innovation, CMU is the perfect location to host a Science Olympiad tournament.
We’re excited to share the Carnegie Mellon experience with you!

# Tournament Philosophy
<hr>

We are former Science Olympians, and many of us have been to various invitational tournaments. As a result, we have a good idea of what features make for a great invitational. With these features in mind, we have designed CMU Science Olympiad to be the invitational we dreamed of going to. Some of the key aspects of CMU Science Olympiad include
- **High Quality Exams:** Exams are the core of any Science Olympiad tournament. Good exams provide the basis for a good tournament, and conversely, a tournament
with poor quality exams will never be a good experience. As a result, our team focuses heavily on writing high quality exams. We strive to stay consistent
with the official rules while making our exams reasonably difficult. We believe that this approach will create a maximally enjoyable experience for our competitors while
also preparing them for future Science Olympiad tournaments.
- **Exams and Answer Keys returned post-tournament:** Taking exams in a tournament setting is an important learning experience, but you can only really learn from your mistakes
if you are given the chance to go back and see what you did wrong. To allow for this complete learning experience, we grade and return all exams to the teams. Blank copies
of the exams (which can be used for additional practice) and answer keys will also be provided to all attending teams in electronic format.
- **Rigorous Build Testing:** All too often, a build with a rules violation places a huge handicap on a team at an official competition, when the very same build slipped
past at an invitational tournament. This won't happen at Carnegie Mellon, where we have among our staff national building medalists who truly know the rules inside and out.
Some of our staff are also active Pennsylvania state event supervisors, and our building chair has participated in the writing of the national Scrambler rules. With
all this experience, we can ensure that despite following regional rules, we will be judging your builds with national-level rigor.
- **Dedicated Volunteers:** A college campus that you aren't used to can be confusing to navigate. You can count on our helpful volunteer staff to get you to your events and provide
you assistance in any other form.
- **Streamlined Registration process:** We want to make the process of registering and attending our invitational as easy as possible for you. As such, we plan to implement a registration
process that will keep the amount of required paperwork to a minimum. We will also distribute as much information as possible online before the tournament, so that all operations on the big
day will be as streamlined as possible.

# Events
<hr>
We plan to run all 23 of the official 2019 Division C events. We may also be running Pennsylvania trial events, but this is subject to change. Exams will be written and proofread by the members of the CMU Science Olympiad
student organization, most of whom are former Science Olympians. Wherever it makes a difference, we will be following regional rules.
