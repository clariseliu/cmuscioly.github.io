# 2021 Tournament
<hr>

Welcome to the 2020-2021 Science Olympiad season! The upcoming season will be
unique in many ways, but we're pleased to announce that we'll still be bringing
the CMU Science Olympiad experience to you in a safe and secure manner.

**Update:** Due to the high level of interest in our tournament, we are instead
planning to run our tournament on multiple days following January 9, 2021, with
grading and results to come a few days later. We will be releasing more updates
as we continue to plan; please sign up for our mailing list to stay up to date.

## Mini SO

The 2021 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational is tentatively scheduled
for **January 9th, 2021**. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are planning to
hold a **Mini SO tournament** this year, which we plan to conduct
synchronously. In short:

1. The tournament will be run entirely remotely.
2. Team members and coaches are **not** required to meet physically.
3. As a result, we will not be able to run all events.

As the semester progresses and we start designing the events, expect much more
precise information regarding the tournament format. This is our first time
hosting a tournament in this format, and we're figuring things out as we go.

For more information on the "Mini SO" format, please check out the
<a href="https://www.soinc.org/play/tournaments" target="_blank">National Science Olympiad website</a>.

To register for the tournament, and to sign up for our mailing list, please see
