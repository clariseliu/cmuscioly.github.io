The 2022 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational will take place on
<strong>Saturday, January 15th, 2022</strong>.

<p>
We are tentively planning for an in-person invitational, but plans may be
subject to change based on COVID case rates closer to the date.

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>
Registration is now open! Please see the <a href="/registration">registration</a> page for more details. Due to capacity 
restrictions on campus, we will only be allowing 25 teams to register with
a 3 team cap per school. Registration fees will be $100 per TEAM (not school). 
</p>

<p>
In order to allow more teams to be able to participate, we will be releasing a financial need
based scholarship form soon to waive the registation fees for schools who qualify.
</p>

<h2>Schedule of Events</h2>

<p>
We will be running all 23 events from the official Division C Science Olympiad event. 
Currently we have no plan for trial events, but this may be subject to change. 
Where it makes difference, we will be following <strong> Regionals rules </strong> for all events.
