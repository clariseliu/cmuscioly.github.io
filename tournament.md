<p>
The 2022 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational will take place on
<strong>Saturday, January 15th, 2022</strong>.
</p>

<p>
We are tentively planning for an in-person invitational, but plans may be
subject to change based on COVID case rates closer to the date.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>
Registration will open on Friday, October 1st, 2021 at 4pm ET. Due to capacity 
restrictions on campus, we will only be allowing 25 teams to register. Since the number of 
teams is smaller we will be placing a 2 team restriction per school. Registration fees will be 
$100 per TEAM (not school). 
</p>

<p>
In order to allow more teams to be able to participate, we will be releasing a financial need
based scholarship form soon to waive the registation fees for schools who qualify.
</p>

<h2>Schedule of Events</h2>

<p>
We will be running all 23 events from the official Division C Science Olympiad event. 
Currently we have no plan for trial events, but this may be subject to change. 
Where it makes difference, we will be following <strong> Regionals rules </strong> for all events.
