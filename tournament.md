Buses can unload students on Tech Street near Posner Hall for a short amount of time, then park in the Morewood Gardens parking lot near the Tepper building. For smaller vehicles, free parking is available on weekends and after 5pm on weekdays in the East Campus garage, located next to the Cohon University Center.
