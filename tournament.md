# 2021 Tournament
<hr>

Welcome to the 2020-2021 Science Olympiad season! The upcoming season will be
unique in many ways, but we're pleased to announce that we'll still be bringing
the CMU Science Olympiad experience to you in a safe and secure manner.

The 2021 Carnegie Mellon Science Olympiad Invitational is tentatively scheduled
for **Saturday, January 9th, 2021**. Events will only take place on Saturday.
However, due to the high level of interest, the tournament results will not be
available until a few days later.

We will be releasing more updates as we continue to plan; please sign up for
our mailing list to stay up to date.

## Mini SO

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are planning to hold a **Mini SO tournament**
this year, which we plan to conduct synchronously. In short:

1. The tournament will be run entirely remotely.
2. Team members and coaches are **not** required to meet physically.
3. As a result, we will not be able to run all events.

As the semester progresses and we start designing the events, expect much more
precise information regarding the tournament format. This is our first time
hosting a tournament in this format, and we're figuring things out as we go.

For more information on the "Mini SO" format, please check out the
<a href="https://www.soinc.org/play/tournaments" target="_blank">National Science Olympiad website</a>.

## Schedule of Events

Our event list has been finalized. In following with the PA Board's decisions,
we have made the following changes:

1. We will **not run** the Digital Structures event.
2. We will be using the CAD software **Tinkercad** for **Write It CAD It** (NOT
   SkyCiv).

Thus, our Mini SO tournament will run 19 events total, as follows, with Write
It CAD It being a **trial event**. Our Scilympiad page has been updated to
reflect these changes.

<blockquote class="ml-4">
<p>
  Anatomy, Astronomy, Chem, Circuit Lab, Codebusters, Designer Genes,
  Detector Building, Disease Detectives, Dynamic Planet, Experimental Design,
  Forensics Lab, Fossils, Geologic Mapping, Machines, Ornithology, Protein
  Modeling, Sounds of Music, Water Quality, Write It CAD It
</p>
</blockquote>

Wherever it makes a difference, we will be following the **Regionals rules**
for all events.

## Tournament schedule

All times are provided in Eastern Standard Time (UTC-05:00).

* January 9th, from 10AM &ndash; 10PM: Students take exams.
* January 10th and 11th: Grading
* January 12th, evening: Awards ceremony via webinar (Details TBA)

## Exam logistics

* Students will have a 12-hour window, from 10AM-10PM EST on January 9th to
  take their exams. Once one or all partners start an exam, they will have 60
  minutes to complete it. This allows 10 additional minutes to account for
  technical difficulties.

* Though there is a built-in chat feature on Scilympiad that allows partners to
  message one another, partners are also permitted to video call (Zoom, Skype,
  FaceTime, etc.) one another while they take the exam. Video calling is only
  allowed between official partners! No one is allowed to meet in person, under
  any circumstances.

* Event proctors will be available 10AM-4PM EST on January 9th to answer
  questions via the Scilympiad chat feature. All questions for an exam will be
  compiled into an FAQ document linked at the beginning of the exam.

* Right now, Scilympiad doesn't support picture uploads from students, and this
  may pose a problem for questions that require work to be shown. If needed, we
  will provide a Google Drive link within exams for students to upload their
  work to. Students will need a phone to take pictures of their work and upload
  them to this Drive.

* Students will need internet access to compete on Scilympiad. Should anyone
  encounter connection issues, please email cmuscioly@gmail.com.

## Other logistics

* Team numbers are available on Scilympiad, and are viewable in [this
  speadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ycnGE-mE1ICHgvkReIH7VtafxFqIFKvMdKxRgMKbq3w/edit?usp=sharing).

* Release forms have been uploaded to Scilympiad. So far, there are only two
  forms required this year: one for coaches/chaperones and another for parents.
  Coaches should be instructed by Scilympiad to send the forms to the relevant
  people, who can then electronically sign them. These forms must be submitted
  by the day of the tournament, before students begin competing. Please note
  that Carnegie Mellon University also requires a release form, which we will
  obtain and notify you of in due time.

* We will have a Zoom meeting open **10AM-10PM EST** to tend to general/technical
  questions or issues.

* Remember to start submitting your student/team rosters and assigning students
  to events!

* We've received a few questions on payment and would like to reiterate that
  the tournament is free this year!

* We will mail out medals and trophies to schools after the tournament.
