# Our Mission
<hr>

CMU Science Olympiad is a student organization that seeks to inspire interest in the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among youth by hosting one annual Science Olympiad invitational tournament. Our tournament features challenging exams and rigorous competition, and teams will find it to provide invaluable preparation for Science Olympiad competitions at the regional, state, and national levels.

# Tournament Philosophy
<hr>

We are former Science Olympians, and many of us have been to various invitational tournaments. As a result, we have a good idea of what features make for a great invitational. With these features in mind, we have designed CMU Science Olympiad to be the invitational we dreamed of going to. Some of the key aspects of CMU Science Olympiad include
- **High Quality Exams:** Exams are the core of any Science Olympiad tournament. Good exams provide the basis for a good tournament, and conversely, a tournament
with poor quality exams will never be a good experience. As a result, our team focuses heavily on writing high quality exams. We strive to stay consistent
with the official rules while making our exams reasonably difficult. We believe that this approach will create a maximally enjoyable experience for our competitors while
also preparing them as well as possible for future Science Olympiad tournaments.
- **Exams and Answer Keys returned post-tournament:** Taking exams in a tournament setting is an important learning experience, but you can only really learn from your mistakes
if you are given the chance to go back and see what you did wrong. To allow for this complete learning experience, we grade and return all exams to the teams. Blank copies
of the exams (which can be used for additional practice) and answer keys will also be provided to all attending teams in electronic format.
