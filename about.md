# Our Mission
<hr>

CMU Science Olympiad is a student-run organization that seeks to inspire interest in the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among youth by hosting annual Science Olympiad intvitational tournaments. Our tournament features challenging exams and rigorous competition, and teams will find it to provide invaluable preparation for Science Olympiad competitions at the regional, state, and national levels.

# History
<hr>

The CMU Science Olympiad student organization was founded in late 2017 by Sarah Yu, Chris Fulton, Revanth Gumpu, and Uday Shankar. Since then, the organization has amassed a group of highly dedicated
members who have worked together to prepare for next year's tournament. The organization ~~plans to host~~ HAS SUCCESSFULLY HOSTED its first invitational tournament in early 2019.

# Tournament Philosophy
<hr>

We are all former Science Olympians, and collectively, we’ve been to tournaments all over the nation. We have designed CMU Science Olympiad with all our experiences in mind, to make yours as enjoyable as it possibly could be. Some of the key aspects of CMU Science Olympiad include:
- **High Quality Exams:** Exams are the core of any Science Olympiad experience. Our team focuses on writing high quality exams, and we strive to stay consistent with the official rules while making our exams challenging. We believe that this approach will create a maximally enjoyable experience for our competitors while
also preparing them for future Science Olympiad tournaments.
- **Exams and Answer Keys returned post-tournament:** We grade and return all exams to teams. Blank copies of the exams and answer keys will be made available to all attending teams, for additional review and practice.
- **Rigorous Build Testing:** Among our staff are national building medalists who know the rules inside and out. Some are also active Pennsylvania state event supervisors, and our Build Chair has participated in the writing of the national Scrambler rules. We will assess builds strictly but fairly, while providing quality feedback.
- **Dedicated Volunteers:** A college campus can be confusing to navigate. You can count on our helpful volunteer staff to get you to your events and provide
any other form of assistance.
- **Streamlined Registration process:** We want to make the process of registering and attending our invitational as efficient as possible. As such, we plan to implement a registration
process that will keep the amount of paperwork to a minimum. We will also distribute as much information as possible online before the tournament, so that all operations on the big
day will be streamlined.

    <p class="mb-1">Chris competed in Science Olympiad for 7 years, with a heavy focus on build events. He finds that long walks on the beach, deep meaningful conversations and Cheez-Its are his biggest joys in life. As a kid he always aspired to be a magician until his mother told him that he needed a "real job."  </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Favorite Events: Scrambler, Optics, Electric Vehicle, Write It Do It</p>

    <small class="text-muted"> Computer Science 2021 </small>
    <p class="mb-1">Uday competed in Science Olympiad for 5 years in middle and high school. Being a long-time programmer, he naturally got forced onto Game On in his sophomore, junior, and senior years and eventually grew to love the event. He now spends the majority of his free time insisting that Game On is not a meme and defending the event from the mockery of unenlightened souls.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Favorite Events: Chemistry Lab, Game On</p>

    <p class="mb-1">Riya's ultimate goal is to own a corgi someday. She loves anything with melty cheese.
    Riya loves being part of Science Olympiad because it challenges her to think about STEM from a different perspective. Since she never had the opportunity to do Science Olympiad in high school, she’s happy she gets the chance be a part of it at CMU, and she’s invested in making this tournament the best it can possibly be!

      <small>Membership Chair</small>

    <small class="text-muted"> Computer Science 2021 </small>
    <p class="mb-1">Revanth competed in Science Olympiad for 5 years in middle and high school. He has a knack for memorizing vast quantities of information, which makes events like Rocks and Minerals
    perfect for him. He also loves building and physics, and he considers the 48 hours before a tournament (in which he does not sleep, eat, or do anything but study and build) to be the quintessential
    Science Olympiad experience.
